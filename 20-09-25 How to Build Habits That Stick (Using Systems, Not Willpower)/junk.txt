<!--          <p class="paragraph">The solution isn’t to push harder. Rather, Habits stick because of the structure around them. In this blog, I’ll show you a <span class="important-text">proven system</span> that you can use redesign structure that will fit whatever habit you are trying to build or drop.</p>       

          <p class="paragraph">
            A system is simply a process or structure that makes the desired behavior the default. In other words, it’s a chain of small habits that work together to make the behavior feel natural.

          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 0rem;">
            Think of it like this: when that burst of motivation hits and you say, “I’m going to hit the gym tomorrow,” we usually assume willpower will be enough to get us out of bed. But that’s the mistake. A system helps you prepare for the real obstacles, like:
          </p>

          <ul class="paragraph">
            <li>What if I’m too tired to get out of bed tomorrow?</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="paragraph">
            When you start operating with a system, you realize that waking up early for the gym tomorrow starts with going to bed early tonight. That’s how systems work: they connect small actions in advance so the bigger habit becomes automatic. Next, we’ll walk through how you can build your own system step by step.

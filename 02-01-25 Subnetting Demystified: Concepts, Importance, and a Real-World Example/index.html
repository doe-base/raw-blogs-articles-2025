            <p class="paragraph">The goal of this article is to give you a clear understanding of what subnetting is, its importance, and a real-world example of subnetting in action. To fully grasp the concepts in this article, you need a good understanding of what an IP address is, its structure, subnet masks, and CIDR notation. All of these topics are covered in this article: <a class="blog-link" href="/blog/5">[Decoding IP Addresses: Mastering Subnet Mask and CIDR Notation]</a>.</p>

            </header>

            
            <p class="paragraph">A network is simply a group of computers that can communicate with each other. In technical terms, it is a group of hosts within the same IP range. As the size of a network grows, communication becomes increasingly difficult due to heavy traffic loads. To address this issue, large networks can be divided into smaller, more manageable subnetworks (subnets) using a process called subnetting. Subnetting helps reduce congestion by limiting broadcast traffic to smaller groups of hosts.</p>

            <p class="sub-header">Flat Network</p>
            <p class="paragraph">A flat network is a network without subdivisions (subnets), where all devices share the same broadcast domain. This can lead to issues like increased broadcast traffic, scalability problems, and security risks, which subnetting aims to address.</p>

            <p class="sub-header">Example of Subnetting</p>

            <p class="paragraph">Suppose you have a <span class="important-text">Class C</span> IP address <span class="folder">192.168.1.0/24</span> that needs to be divided into 4 subnets. The total number of possible IPs is 256, ranging from <span class="folder">192.168.1.0</span> to <span class="folder">192.168.1.255</span>.</p>

           
            <blockquote class="definition">
              <p class="quote-paragraph">
                  Note: Only 254 IP addresses are available for use because the Network address (<span class="folder">192.168.1.0</span>) and the Broadcast address (<span class="folder">192.168.1.255</span>) are reserved and cannot be assigned to devices. The Network address is the first IP address in the range, and the Broadcast address is the last.
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <p class="paragraph">The subnet can be divided as follow:</p>
            <ul class="paragraph">
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subnet 1:</span> <span class="folder">192.168.1.0/26</span>. This provides a total of 64 IPs from range <span class="folder">192.168.1.0</span> to <span class="folder">192.168.1.63</span></li>

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subnet 2:</span> <span class="folder">192.168.1.64/26</span>. This provides a total of 64 IPs from range <span class="folder">192.168.1.64</span> to <span class="folder">192.168.1.127</span></li>

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subnet 3:</span> <span class="folder">192.168.1.128/26</span>. This provides a total of 64 IPs from range <span class="folder">192.168.1.128</span> to <span class="folder">192.168.1.191</span></li>

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subnet 4:</span> <span class="folder">192.168.1.192/26</span>. This provides a total of 64 IPs from range <span class="folder">192.168.1.192</span> to <span class="folder">192.168.1.255</span></li>

            <p class="paragraph">Some of the importance of dividing a network into subnetworks include:</p>
            <ul class="paragraph">
                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Efficient Use of IP Addresses:</span> Subnetting allows the administrator to allocate only the necessary number of IPs required for that subnet, preventing waste.</li>

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Improved Security:</span> Subnetting reduces security risks by limiting access between subnets. Unlike a flat network, which broadcasts packets and resources to every single host on the network.</li>

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Enhanced Performance:</span> Each subnet runs faster because of the reduced broadcasting traffic burden. For example, it is easier to broadcast a packet to 10 hosts in a subnetwork than to 200 hosts in an undivided, flat network.</li>

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Simplifies Network Management:</span> By dividing networks into subnetworks, the workflow on a topology becomes clearer, making it easier to manage, detect problems, and reduce downtime. When one network goes down, the others can still function properly.</li>

                <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Privacy:</span> Subnetting limits visibility between subnets by isolating sensitive traffic from the general network. For example, the HR department does not need to see the data that travels within the Admin department.</li>

            </header>
            <p class="paragraph">Your company has been assigned the IP network: <span class="folder">192.168.1.0/24</span>. As the Network Admin, you are tasked with dividing this network to serve four different departments in your company:</p>
          
            <ul class="paragraph">
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Admin</span> (50 hosts)</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">HR</span> (25 hosts)</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Staff</span> (30 hosts)</li>
              <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Guest</span> (14 hosts)</li>
            </ul>
        </article>

        <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Each subnet must accommodate the required number of hosts. The formula for calculating how many hosts are available to a network is:</p>
        <p class="paragraph"><span class="important-text">Hosts Available = 2<sup>h</sup> - 2</span></p>

        <ul class="paragraph">
          Where:
          <li><sup>h</sup> is the number of host bits in the IP address.</li>
          <li>2 is subtracted because the network address and the broadcast address are reserved and cannot be used.</li>
        </ul>

        <div>
          <p class="sub-header">Finding the Number of Host Bits (h)</p>
          <p class="paragraph">Let's use the <span class="important-text">Admin</span> subnet as an example. Remember, the <span class="important-text">Admin</span> subnet needs 50 hosts.</p>
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 0;">To find h for this subnet, find the smallest power of 2 that can accommodate the required number of hosts (50) in the subnet using this formula:</p>
          <p class="paragraph"><span class="important-text"> 2<sup>h</sup> ≥ Required Hosts + 2 </span></p>
          
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 0;"><span style="margin-right: 0.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Number of host bits(h) =></span>  2<sup>h</sup> ≥ 50 + 2 </p>
          <p class="paragraph"> After solving, h will equal <span class="folder">6</span> (approximately 5.7, which rounds up to 6).
  
          <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 0;">We can solve for the total number of hosts that will be available to the subnet:</p>
          <p class="paragraph"><span style="margin-right: 0.5rem; font-weight: bold;">Hosts Available =></span> 2<sup>6</sup> - 2 = 62</p>
  
          <p class="paragraph">The <span class="important-text">subnet mask</span> for this subnet will be: <span class="important-text">32 - 6</span>, where 32 is the number of bits in an IP address and 6 is the number of host bits (h). This will give us a subnet mask of <span class="folder">/26</span>.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p class="sub-header">Allocating the Admin Subnet</p>
          <p class="paragraph">From the example above, we can now set the <span class="important-text">Admin</span> Subnet as follows:</p>
          <ul class="paragraph">
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Department</span>: Admin</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Number of host bits(h)</span>: 6</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hosts Needed</span>: 50</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Hosts Available</span>: 62</li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subnet mask</span>: <span class="folder">/26</span> or <span class="folder">255.255.255.192</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Network Address</span>: <span class="folder">192.168.1.0</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Broadcast Address</span>: <span class="folder">192.168.1.63</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">Usable IP Range</span>: <span class="folder">192.168.1.1</span> to <span class="folder">192.168.1.62</span></li>
          </ul>

          <p class="paragraph">Using this example, allocate the subnet for the <span class="important-text">HR</span>, <span class="important-text">Staff</span>, and <span class="important-text">Guest</span> subnets. If you get stuck anywhere, feel free to reach out to me or leave a comment.</p>

        <p class="paragraph">VPNs, like many tools in technology, offer both advantages and drawbacks. A significant downside is the latency and reduced network performance they can sometimes cause. Over the years, various VPN implementations have been developed to tackle these challenges and improve overall efficiency.</p>
        <p class="paragraph">This article explores several state-of-the-art VPN implementations to assess the extent of performance degradation they experience. It is based on a 2019 study conducted by Thomas Fischer at the University of Sk√∂vde. The research question is as follows: <br> <span class="important-text">How does the performance differ between state-of-the-art VPN solutions under stable versus unreliable network conditions?</span></p>

            </header>            
            <p class="paragraph">A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology used to extend a private network over the internet, allowing authorized users (typically authenticated with a shared secret such as a password) to access it as if they were directly connected. This makes these "authorized users" appear to be connected to the private network, even though they may be thousands of miles and numerous router hops away.</p>

            <div>
              <p class="sub-header">VPN Tunnel</p>
              <p class="paragraph">VPN connection is achieved using secure, encrypted "tunnels" called <span class="important-text">VPN tunnels</span>. They are referred to as tunnels because they are established between two endpoints. When two routers are configured for tunneling, it becomes possible to send encrypted packets that might not be supported over the general internet between them. <br/> When set up correctly, these tunnels provide:</p>
                <ul class="paragraph">
                  <li><span class="bold">Privacy</span>: By not exposing the private network to the public internet.</li>
                  <li><span class="bold">Security</span>: By encrypting the packets shared through the tunnels. Anyone who gains access to the encrypted packets will not be able to read them. Only authorized users can decrypt and access the data.</li>
                  <li><span class="bold">Data integrity</span>: Through mechanisms that detect if the data has been tampered with during transport.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="paragraph">
                Any network running such tunnel is running a Virtual Private Network or VPN.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
              <p class="sub-header">Types of VPN Tunneling</p>
              <ul class="paragraph">
                <li><span class="bold">Host-to-network (Remote access) tunneling</span>: Allows individual users to securely connect to a private network. This is commonly used by remote workers who need access to private company files.</li>

                <li><span class="bold">Site-to-site tunneling</span>: Connects entire networks, often used by companies with offices in different locations.</li>

                <li><span class="bold">Split tunneling</span>: Routes only specific traffic through the VPN, while other traffic is sent directly to the internet. This is useful for balancing security and speed.</li>

                <li><span class="bold">Full tunneling</span>: Routes all traffic through the VPN, providing maximum privacy and security.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- <div>
              <p class="sub-header">A Real-World Example of When VPNs Are Used</p>
              <p class="paragraph" style="margin-bottom: 0;">Imagine a company with offices in Chicago, New York, and Miami, each with its own local ISP (Internet Service Provider). The company can use VPN solutions to create secure and private "VPN tunnels" connecting these offices. This ensures secure communication and resource sharing among them, instead of transmitting sensitive company data directly over the public and untrusted internet.</p>
              <p class="paragraph">Similarly, VPNs offer the same solution for remote workers, allowing them to securely access company resources while working from home or other locations.</p>
            </div> -->

            <blockquote class="definition">
              <p class="quote-paragraph">
                Side Note: VPNs provide security between two endpoints, but they do not secure the endpoints themselves. This poses a significant security risk because every endpoint with access to your VPN also has access to your private network. Additional security measures are necessary to ensure endpoint security and protect the network from potential vulnerabilities.

            <div class="line"></div>
          </header>
          <p class="paragraph">There are numerous VPN solutions available, but three stand out as the most popular and were used for this study: </p>
          <ul class="paragraph">
            <li class="bold">IPSec (IP Security Protocol)</li>
            <li class="bold">OpenVPN</li>
            <li class="bold">WireGuard</li>
          </ul>
          
          <div>
            <p class="sub-header">IPsec (IP Security Protocol)</p>
            <p class="paragraph">IPsec was standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in 1995. Originally developed for IPv6, it has also been widely implemented for IPv4. IPsec is an IETF-approved end-to-end authentication and encryption system. Almost all major VPN vendors include at least an IPsec compatibility mode in their products. Additionally, operating systems like Linux, Solaris, HP-UX, and AIX provide native kernel support for IPsec.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">In tunnel mode, IPsec encrypts the transport layer header, which includes source and destination port numbers. However, this approach often conflicts with how most firewalls operate. To address this issue, most modern implementations default to transport mode, where only the payloads of packets (the data being transported) are encrypted.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="sub-header">OpenVPN</p>
            <p class="paragraph">OpenVPN has become the de facto standard for VPNs today, with over 50 million downloads since its release in 2001 (OpenVPN, 2019). It uses SSL/TLS for key exchange and encryption. OpenVPN is open-source, which contributes to its security through the extensive scrutiny it undergoes, as anyone can review the code. In 2017, an independent review of OpenVPN was conducted by Cryptography Engineering (Hopkins and Green, 2019), and the results found no major vulnerabilities.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">OpenVPN supports both TCP and UDP, with UDP as the default. While UDP is faster, it does not perform error correction like TCP does. OpenVPN is fully functional on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and offers a wide range of ciphers and encryption methods to choose from.</p>
          </div>

          <div>
            <p class="sub-header">WireGuard</p>
            <p class="paragraph">WireGuard is a new VPN solution designed to replace two of the most widely used VPN technologies: OpenVPN and IPSec (Donenfeld, 2018). It claims to offer better performance than OpenVPN while avoiding the complexity of IPSec. Originally written for Linux systems, WireGuard is now available on multiple platforms. Like OpenVPN and IPSec, it is open-source, allowing anyone with the knowledge to audit the code. One of its design goals is to offer a straightforward configuration, similar to SSH, using asymmetric key cryptography. Currently, WireGuard supports only UDP (Donenfeld, 2018).</p>
          </div>

          <p class="paragraph"><span class="bold">Some other VPN solutions include: PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol), SSTP (Secure Socket Tunneling Protocol), and OpenSSH (Open Secure Shell).</p>

                <div class="line"></div>
            </header>            
            <p class="paragraph">Here are the key metrics used in this study when testing networks: <span class="important-text">throughput</span>, <span class="important-text">latency</span>, and <span class="important-text">packet loss</span>:</p>

            <ul class="paragraph">
              <li><span class="bold">Throughput</span>: This refers to how much data is sent from one point to another during a specific time frame. Throughput is typically measured in bits per second (bps). It is influenced by the entire infrastructure of the channel, including the physical medium (such as cabling) and computational power, among other factors.</li>

              <li><span class="bold">Latency</span>: Latency is the time it takes to transmit a packet in one direction (e.g., from client to server). In VPN testing, latency is expressed as a time value, usually measured in milliseconds (ms).</li>

              <li><span class="bold">Packet loss</span>: This metric refers to how many packets are ‚Äúlost,‚Äù meaning they did not arrive from the source to the destination. Packet loss can occur due to network congestion, among other reasons. It is measured as a percentage of packets lost relative to the total packets sent.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="sub-header">Unreliability Handling</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Unreliability handling refers to how a network manages disturbances, which can be either artificial or natural, such as high latency or packet loss. These disturbances can be quantified by limiting the aforementioned metrics.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">For example, consider a remote worker with an unreliable network connection. The unreliability of a network could stem from fluctuating connections, such as cellular networks on a moving train traveling through areas with poor infrastructure or through mountains. It could also involve a remote worker located far from the office, requiring access to files stored across the globe. This would introduce delays far beyond the typical packet transfer delay expected when working with files stored on a server in the same building.</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Therefore, it is crucial to investigate how different VPN solutions perform on unreliable networks.</p>

              <div class="line"></div>
          </header>

          <p class="sub-header">iPerf</p>
          <p class="paragraph">The tool used to measure network performance is <span class="important-text">iPerf3</span> (https://iperf.fr), version 3.1.3. The reason for choosing iPerf3 is that it effectively tests throughput and provides data on the number of packets transferred, including those that did not arrive. Since iPerf is available for Windows, Linux, and macOS, it is well-suited for this experiment, which is being conducted across all three operating systems.</p>
          
          <p class="sub-header">Operating systems</p>
          <p class="paragraph">The test was performed on 3 different operating systems: <span class="important-text">Windows 10</span>, <span class="important-text">Linux Ubuntu</span>, and <span class="important-text">macOS</span>.</p>

          <p class="sub-header">pfSense router</p>
          <p class="paragraph">The router used in this experiment is a <span class="bold">pfSense software</span> router running FreeBSD 11.2-RELEASE-p10 (pfSense 2.4.4-RELEASE-p3). The reason for choosing this router is its capability to shape traffic directly using a tool called <span class="important-text">dummynet</span>, which is built into pfSense. With dummynet, it is possible to introduce network unreliability aspects (such as delay and packet loss) directly between the VPN nodes. This approach eliminates the need for using dedicated tools or software on the individual nodes themselves, simplifying the setup and ensuring more accurate control over network conditions for the experiment.</p>

              <h1 class="topic" id="default-configuration">Important aspects of the default configuration for each VPN that could impact the perform</h1>
              <div class="line"></div>
          </header>
          <p class="paragraph">As mentioned earlier, the three VPN solutions selected for this test are OpenVPN, WireGuard, and IPSec. It is important to note that the default configurations of these VPN solutions were used. For all three VPN solutions, default settings were maintained wherever possible, rather than standardizing the settings across network protocols, cryptographic algorithms, or compression choices.</p>
          <p class="paragraph">After setting up the three VPN solutions on three different operating systems, below are some important aspects of the default configuration for each VPN that could impact the perform:</p>

          <ul class="paragraph">
            <li><span class="bold">Encryption Algorithm</span>: The performance of a VPN is significantly affected by the encryption algorithm used. Different algorithms have varying computational complexities, which can impact both the encryption/decryption speed and overall VPN performance.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Compression</span>: Compression of the payload is another factor. By default, all the tested VPN solutions have payload compression disabled. Enabling compression can reduce the size of the data being transmitted, potentially improving performance, especially in environments with high latency or limited bandwidth.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Multi-threading</span>: Multi-threading specifies whether the encryption and decryption processes can be distributed across multiple CPU cores. This feature allows parallel encryption on multiple cores, which could increase the speed of encryption and decryption, leading to better overall performance for the VPN.</li>

            <li><span class="bold">Test with Unreliability #2</span>: In the final round, the traffic shaping tool introduced 1% packet loss (Unreliability #2), and the VPNs were tested once more.</li>
           </ol>

           <p class="paragraph">This process was repeated for all three VPN solutions (OpenVPN, WireGuard, and IPSec)</p>

          <p class="paragraph">To reiterate, the research question for this paper is: <span style="font-style: italic;" class="bold">"How does performance differ between state-of-the-art VPN solutions under stable versus unreliable network conditions?"</span> A definitive conclusion is that each implementation has its own advantages and disadvantages. Some VPN solutions perform better on certain operating systems. The most impactful conclusions drawn from the results are presented below.</p>          
          
          <ul class="paragraph">
            <li>The best-performing VPN solution for macOS, if the network is reliable, was IPSec, followed by WireGuard, with OpenVPN performing the worst.</li>

            <li>We can see that with any of the unreliability variables in effect, all VPNs and operating systems had reduced throughput compared to no unreliability.</li>

            <li>Linux is fastest with the baseline and no unreliability at 943.5Mbits/sec</li>

            <li>All VPNs except OpenVPN perform best in Linux during the delay unreliability when comparing the other OSs under delay</li>

            <li>All VPNs perform best in Linux while experiencing packet loss</li>

            <li>OpenVPN is not the top performer in any test</li>

            <li>Linux performs best in all unreliability tests except one, the unreliability #1 ‚Äì delay</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="paragraph">Based on the results, a few recommendations for OS and VPN combinations emerged when using the default configuration. They can be seen in the Table below. The VPN in bold with a blue background is the overall recommended option for the specific network situation, as it had the best performance. The recommendations are as follows:</p>
